According to clinical psychologist Judy Kurianski, fast rides can serve as outlets when you feel anxious because they expose you to 'good fear.' So, while you may feel a bit nervous beforehand, a ride on the bumper cars can be truly therapeutic, especially if you leave all your worries and anxiety aside for a while!"

Due to this size, it requires quite a bit of walking to explore all the games it offers. As a result, you often end up walking much farther than you imagine, sometimes even several kilometers. We don't notice it because we are focused not on how far we go but on all the fun things we can do! Can you think of a more enjoyable way to lose weight?"

What's so amazing about Yuppii Luna Park is that it gives us the opportunity to unleash our inner child and reconnect with that sense of fun and joy. In fact, Yuppii encourages us to become kids ourselves, to have fun, and fully embrace the chance to momentarily forget the outside world where we have to be responsible and just live in this magical moment. We often forget how wonderful it is to be a child, so let's not forget that there is a place in Alexandroupolis that not only encourages us but also gives us an excuse to become a child again!"
